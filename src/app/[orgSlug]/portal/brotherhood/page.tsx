      {/* The heading rides inside the engraved plate, so it belongs to the
          component rather than the page — see ChainOfCommand.

          The plate is painted art laid out at width:100% / height:auto with
          every face and nameplate pinned to that art's own pixel grid, so its
          height is purely a function of its width. It sits OUTSIDE the gallery
          column rather than inside it: at 116rem it is deliberately wider than
          PAGE_W.gallery (96rem), and a child cannot exceed a capped parent.

          Widening it is the whole point rather than an accident of layout —
          this is the club's front door, and it is the one thing on the page
          worth the pixels of a big screen. Below ~116rem of room it simply
          takes what it is given, so narrower screens are unaffected.

          It therefore OVERHANGS the roster wall beneath it on a very wide
          screen, by design: the plate is the banner and the wall is the
          content under it. On anything up to about 1920 the overhang is a
          couple of dozen pixels and the two read as flush. */}

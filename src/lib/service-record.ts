 * Pure resolver: (join date + patch awards + stored career log) → the rows the
 * Service Record panel renders, newest first.
 *
 * The club records a member's history in three places and never joined them up:
 * the `serviceRecord` subcollection (rank/role changes, written by the member
 * actions), `awardedPatches`, and the join date on the member doc. This merges
 * them as a derived view rather than backfilling a fourth collection — so it
 * works for members who joined years ago and can never drift from the awards.
 *
 * No I/O, no framework: unit-testable, same as buildRenderModel.

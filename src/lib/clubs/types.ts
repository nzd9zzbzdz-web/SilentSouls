/**
 * Everything a club brings with it that lives in the REPO rather than in
 * Firestore: its palette, its shipped artwork, and its long-form copy.
 *
 * This exists because "shared defaults" and "multi-tenant" are incompatible.
 * The Ravens' palette and artwork used to BE the platform default, so any club
 * that had not yet uploaded a logo rendered the Ravens' patch, and any club
 * that had not written its own history rendered the Ravens' history. Nothing
 * leaked between Firestore documents, but everything leaked through the
 * fallbacks.
 *
 * So a preset is keyed by ORG SLUG. `silent-souls` is the Ravens; anything
 * without a preset gets `PLATFORM_PRESET`, which is deliberately blank. A new
 * club can therefore never inherit another club's identity by omission — the
 * worst it can do is look unfinished, which is the honest state of a club
 * nobody has branded yet.
 *
 * A preset is only the STARTING POINT. Everything here is overridden by the
 * org's branding documents the moment an admin saves anything in
 * Admin -> Branding, and by uploaded artwork the moment they replace a slot.
